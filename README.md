This project tackles multi-class text classification, involving data understanding, pre-processing, and four ML models (SGD, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) with metric evaluation and improvement suggestions.
This project addresses a multi-class text classification problem. The initial phase involves understanding the data, which comprises textual information with associated labels. Data preprocessing and cleaning are crucial for handling noisy data. Bigrams are used to capture meaningful two-word combinations. Feature extraction employs TF-IDF vectorization. Four machine learning models, namely Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier with log loss, SGD Classifier with hinge loss, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes Classifier, are implemented and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, macro F1, micro F1, and Hamming loss. The project concludes by highlighting the models' performance and identifies improvement areas such as advanced feature engineering and ensemble methods to enhance model accuracy.
